## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

this project was a little different for me .
I worked on other project with theme changing but it was not as big as this so i had to use different process .
I always have different style for mobile but here I did style for different devices on one style file but for different themes.

### Built with

-Html5 markup
-Scss
-Flexbox
-Vanilla script (plan Javascript)

### What I learned

I learned about different themes on big projects.

### Continued development

so I just built a simple calculator and I couldn't add more features due to short time I will work on project later.
